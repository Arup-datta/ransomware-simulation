Instructions:

The client side file (trojan) attempts to connect to url.  This (url) variable should be set to something that will resolve on the client side.

1) For example, add a line to /etc/hosts for www.foo.com and foo.com as below:

127.0.0.1	localhost
...
10.0.0.254	www.foo.com
10.0.0.254	foo.com
...

2) The server is configured by default to listen on port 80 and will delivery the cryptor and key to the client.  Suggest to configure the server with a static IP address which is aligned with the client /etc/hosts foo.com and www.foo.com such as 10.0.0.254 or other non-routable IP.

3) encyrpt256 needs to be in the same directory on the server as server.py.  encrypt256 can be adjusted to encrypt files in a specific directory.  The prototype is set to encrypt /home/student/test directory. Change it as you wish for testing.

4) A decryptor is provided in case of emergency (you will need to fetch the key from request_log.txt on the server).

5) The detected-mitigator script should run in it's own window.

6) THe C&C logfile for the attacker's C&C server is created in the current working directory.  The logfile can be used to link the UUID on the ransom note printed to the encryption key and the time of infection.  The file has the form:

UUID EncyptionKey VictimIP AccessTime
